# RPC - Remote Procedure Calls

RPC means Remote Procedure Call. This is the way to send commands to devices
and receive replies, i.e. call remote procedures.
Mongoose OS uses
[JSON-RPC 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC).

Since the RPC mechanism uses JSON-RPC, that means that the "procedure",
or an "RPC service" that device implements, is a function written in C/C++
or JavaScript with the following properties:

- Has a name, for example `GPIO.Toggle`,
- Takes a `params` JSON object,
- Returns a `result` JSON object.

For example, an RPC request to set GPIO pin 2 to high voltage looks like this:

```json
{ "id": 1932, "method": "GPIO.Write", "params": {"pin": 2, "value": 1} }
```

The successful reply from a device looks like this:

```json
{ "id": 1932, "result": true }
```

The failure reply looks like this:

```json
{ "id": 1932, "error": { "code": 400, "message": "error setting pin mode"} }
```

Note that the `"jsonrpc": "2.0"` attribute in the request frame can be omitted.

Mongoose OS libraries implement a large set of ready-to-go RPC services,
like managing hardware peripherals (GPIO, SPI, I2C), managing files,
remote updates, etc. It is easy to add custom RPC services too,
see [RPC Core library](../api/rpc/rpc-common.md) for more details.

The JSON-RPC messages could be carried out by many different channels:
serial (UART), HTTP/Restful, WebSocket, MQTT, Bluetooth. RPC API allows
to add support for other channels. `mos` tool provides an easy way to call
device's RPC services over the serial connection or over the network.
Alternatively, RPC services can be invoked programmatically.

That means, you can write a function in C or JavaSciprt,
and call it remotely via multiple protocols. Example: 
an RPC service `Sum` that adds two numbers `a` and `b`:

```javascript
RPC.addHandler('Sum', function(args) {
  if (typeof(args) === 'object' && typeof(args.a) === 'number' && typeof(args.b) === 'number') {
    return args.a + args.b;
  } else {
    return {error: -1, message: 'Bad request. Expected: {"a":N1,"b":N2}'};
  }
});
```

See [RPC.addHandler API reference](../api/rpc/rpc-common.md#rpc-addhandler).
The C/C++ implementation that does the same would look something like this:

```c
#include "mgos_rpc.h"

static void sum_cb(struct mg_rpc_request_info *ri, void *cb_arg,
                   struct mg_rpc_frame_info *fi, struct mg_str args) {
  double a = 0, b = 0;
  if (json_scanf(args.p, args.len, ri->args_fmt, &a, &b) == 2) {
    mg_rpc_send_responsef(ri, "%.2lf", a + b);
  } else {
    mg_rpc_send_errorf(ri, -1, "Bad request. Expected: {\"a\":N1,\"b\":N2}");
  }
  (void) cb_arg;
  (void) fi;
}

// Somewhere in init function, register the handler:
mg_rpc_add_handler(mgos_rpc_get_global(), "Sum", "{a: %lf, b: %lf}", sum_cb, NULL);
```

See [mgos_rpc_add_handler API reference](../api/rpc/rpc-common.md#mgos_rpc_add_handler). Make sure to
include the `rpc-common` library in your app's `mos.yml`.

Here is how you can call it:

#### Via serial connection, if a device is attached to a serial port:
<pre class="command-line language-bash" data-user="chris" data-host="localhost" data-output="2"><code>mos --port /dev/ttyUSB0 call Sum '{"a":1, "b": 2}'
3</code></pre>

#### Via WebSocket, if a device is in the local network:
> Include `- origin: https://github.com/mongoose-os-libs/rpc-ws` in mos.yml
> Run `mos config-set rpc.ws.enable=true` after flashing with new build.

<pre class="command-line language-bash" data-user="chris" data-host="localhost" data-output="2"><code> mos call --port ws://192.168.0.206/rpc Sum '{"a":1,"b":2}'
3</code></pre>

#### Via RESTful call, if a device is in the local network:
<pre class="command-line language-bash" data-user="chris" data-host="localhost" data-output="2"><code>curl -d '{"a":1, "b": 2}' 192.168.0.206/rpc/Sum
3</code></pre>

#### Via an MQTT server, talking to an device idendified by its ID esp32_6732ac:
<pre class="command-line language-bash" data-user="chris" data-host="localhost" data-output="2"><code>mos --port mqtt://my.mqtt.server:1883/esp32_6732ac call Sum '{"a":1, "b": 2}'
3</code></pre>

To see a list of all RPC services implemented by a device, call `RPC.List`:

<pre class="command-line language-bash" data-user="chris" data-host="localhost" data-output="2-100"><code>mos call RPC.List
[
  "I2C.WriteRegW",
  "I2C.WriteRegB",
  "I2C.ReadRegW",
  "I2C.ReadRegB",
  ...
]</code></pre>


## Remote management

Mongoose OS has many built-in RPC services: for managing files, accessing
hardware peripherals, performing over-the-air updates, etc. In fact,
the majority of `mos` command talks to a device via an RPC call.

See [Secure remote device management with Mongoose OS and AWS IoT](https://mongoose-os.com/blog/secure-remote-device-management-with-mongoose-os-and-aws-iot-for-esp32-esp8266-ti-cc3200-stm32/)
for an example of remote management over the secure AWS IoT cloud. In that
case, Mongoose OS uses secure MQTT RPC channel, authenticated via the
mutual TLS - per AWS IoT standards.

An ability to call RPC services via network add an incredible level of
control, implementing remote management capabilities at the highest levels.

Example: scan I2C bus and return addresses of I2C peripherals from a device
at IP address 192.168.1.4 using `mos` tool in a command line mode:

<pre class="command-line language-bash" data-user="chris" data-host="localhost" data-output="2-100"><code>mos --port ws://192.168.1.4/rpc call I2C.Scan
